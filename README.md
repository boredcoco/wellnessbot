# wellnessbot
this bot helps you to keep track of your homework and sends you encouraging messages

what you need
1. repltit
2. discord (because it is a discord bot)
3. a discord server to host your bot
4. uptimerobot (to make the bot run continuously)

what to do
1. create a discord bot
2. paste the token at the bottom of the code, where it says 'PASTE TOKEN HERE' (remember to keep the token within the '')
3. run the code in replit
4. copy the url generated when running the code
5. go to uptimerobot and click 'add new monitor'
6. select 'https' as the monitor type
7. paste the url you copied from replit in the 'url' section
8. click 'create monitor' and your bot should run continuously :)))))

how it works
1. typing "$hello" in the chat will cause the bot to send "hello"
2. if you're down and needing encouragement you can type "$encourage" and the bot will encourage you
3. if you need a listening ear you can always type "$helpme" and this will direct you to hotlines you can call
4. you can add work or tasks by typing "$new" in the chat followed by your task, in other words type "$new (your task)"
5. you can delete tasks by typing "$del" followed by the index of task on the list, starting from zero. For instance, you just cleared your trash and it happens to be the first thing on your list, so you key in "$del 0", since the first item on your task list starts from zero
6. by typing "$list" you can see the list of work you have to do
